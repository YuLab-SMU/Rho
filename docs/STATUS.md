# Rho: current state and focus

Updated: 2026-09-10. This is the single current status summary. Git retains history.

## Multiple R sessions and recovery copies

The instance foundation, native object-graph recovery copies and automatic protection
are implemented and verified; the Studio surface is partly built.
[Design section 17](RHO-DESIGN.md#17-sessions-and-recovery--approved-interaction)
records the approved Paper R04–R10 interaction and
[Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md#multiple-r-instances-and-recovery-copies) records the
ownership, routing and recovery rules. Section 16's R01–R03 remain proposals.

Implemented: a Host instance registry under the existing project lease and journal,
with four distinct identities and per-instance process, queue, stdin, lane,
observations and lifecycle state; instance lifecycle capabilities and explicit
`workspace_instance_id` routing that rejects a missing target instead of guessing one;
native capture of shared-reference graphs and cycles with explicit exclusions, byte
and time budgets, atomic publish and a journal-committed manifest; idle automatic
protection that yields to user execution and cancels cooperatively; retention, storage
reservation and pruning; restore into a fresh candidate process; and the
App → Project → Session policy hierarchy, where a scope write replaces that scope's
override set, so omitting a field is how it resets to the inherited value. The
optional idle release ends an unattended session only after complete protection, and
never when window liveness cannot be observed.

Two edges changed meaning. Selecting R in Workbench settings now records the default
used by sessions created afterwards and never drains or replaces a managed Host, so
running sessions keep their binding and memory; asking it to end a session is refused
and points at stopping that session individually. A running instance no longer holds
project file observations, because each instance owns its lane.

A deferred open deliberately leaves R stopped, so the Workbench now performs the
continuation as its own lifecycle action after opening or switching to a project.
Without it the Studio served a stopped session and every run control stayed disabled.
A workspace operation record's console-state next read now carries the instance taken
from that record's own normalized arguments; the published link was otherwise rejected
and the Console showed a contract error instead of the run's output.

Studio renders the approved daily entry: the status-bar R disclosure names the target
session, reports its latest recovery copy and lists the other sessions with their
state, and the editor toolbar carries a `Run in session` picker beside Run, hidden
while the project has one session and continuing a stopped session when chosen.

### Verified

Passed with real R, using the pinned Ark 0.1.252 build beside the integration checkout
and the installed R home: `scripts/test-r-checkpoints.mjs`, including cold restore of
shared aliases, cycles, hidden and Unicode values, factors and time classes, fitted
models, sparse and in-memory SCE objects, RNG state and options, and no artifact
published after a fractional budget was exhausted; `scripts/test-real-r.mjs`, now
including the real-R multi-instance restore and clean-restart case; and
`scripts/test-environment.mjs`.

Also passed: `cargo test --workspace --locked -- --test-threads=1` (275 tests),
`npm run generate`, `build`, `check` and `typecheck --prefix ui`,
`npm run test --prefix ui` (356 tests), `scripts/governance.mjs check|generate|impact`,
`test-governance.mjs`, `check-architecture.mjs`, `vendor-jet.mjs check`,
`test-vendor-jet.mjs`, `check-frontend-boundaries.mjs`,
`test-frontend-boundaries.mjs`, `test-mcp.mjs` with and without `--real-r`,
`test-workbench.mjs` with and without `--real-r`, `test-output-media.mjs`,
`test-process-recovery.mjs`, `test-remote-protocol.mjs`,
`test-agent-task-recovery.mjs`, `test-agent-interface.mjs --self-test` and
`test-pack-agent-evidence.py`.

`scripts/test-r-checkpoints.mjs` is now the governance check `system.r-checkpoints`,
and `scripts/test-real-r.mjs` now runs the real-R multi-instance acceptance.

### Unresolved

- First run with no R configured at launch: the project Host has no Main instance,
  and recording a default R deliberately does not create one, so R only becomes
  available after a restart. The approved configuration entry (R04/R10) has to create
  the session explicitly; until it exists this path needs a restart.
- Not built: the `R Sessions` management page (R05/R06), the restoring, partial
  restore, environment-mismatch and disconnect states (R07), the restart, stop and
  quit panels (R08), the advanced `Runtime & recovery` settings (R09), and the
  narrow-width layouts and new-session dialog (R10).
- `npm run test:browser --prefix ui` passes 40 of 42 specs once an `ark` sits beside
  the built binary. The two failures are both host-restart specs, and both report the
  same cause: `capture_available` is false, the previous session had activity, so no
  recovery copy exists in its lineage, and auto-continue correctly refuses with
  `recovery_required` rather than silently starting empty. The specs still expect the
  pre-instance behaviour where a restart just brought R back.
- Nothing delivers the native checkpoint component to where a launched Workbench looks
  for it — `<ark directory>/recovery-components/<r_version>-<platform>/`, or an
  explicit `--checkpoint-helper`. `scripts/test-r-checkpoints.mjs` builds it under
  `target/rho-checkpoint/`, which no launch path reads. So in ordinary use no recovery
  copy is ever written, and every restart after activity lands in `Needs attention`.
  This is the highest-priority gap before recovery can be claimed as working.
- The refusal tells the user to "start an empty session or select an earlier recovery
  point", but `ContinueRuntimeInstance` carries only the instance and its lineage, so
  the contract offers no way to start empty. R07's `Start empty` button needs it.
- The new status disclosure and target picker have no browser or real-R visual
  acceptance at normal, wide and constrained widths. The picker's subtitle reads
  `Managed environment` because no environment name is published, while R05 shows a
  named environment.
- Not measured: the editor-input and added-wait latency thresholds, multi-platform and
  long-run behaviour, and destructive-failure acceptance.
- Binding two genuinely different R installations stays opt-in and unexercised; it
  needs `RHO_ALT_*`.
- `rho --connect-url-file invoke --code` needs an explicit `--workspace-instance`; a
  connected Host publishes no contract the CLI can read to default it.
- Real-model Agent acceptance now depends on the Agent supplying
  `workspace_instance_id`, which the augmented tool schema publishes.
- An exiting Host now ends the R processes it started instead of orphaning them, but
  it does not capture a fresh recovery copy first, so objects created since the latest
  automatic copy are lost on Ctrl-C or server shutdown. R08's `Quit Workbench…` panel
  has to save supported objects before each process stops, on top of the explicit
  per-session stop that already does this.
- An Environment realization referenced by an instance or a recovery copy is protected
  from cleanup, but that protection has no dedicated test.

### Restart paths

The work lives in the registered worktree `.worktrees/runtime-recovery` on
`codex/runtime-recovery`, on top of `a4c127da`. Real workbench runs belong in the
integration checkout, not in this worktree.

## Shell navigation and configurable status bar

The user approved [Paper Shell S01–S04](https://app.paper.design/file/01M1XBMB0B5QB82XMDV0Z6VHET/8-0)
and requested optional persistent CPU, memory and disk values. The implemented
48/168 px navigation rail focuses/restores existing modules, offers multiple-view
selection and retains Agent attention/settings entry points. Layout is available
from the top bar. A 30 px footer separates R/queue/input state, user-pinned metrics
and draft synchronization. Narrow windows retain all pinned metrics, using a
second row below 700 px. Project paths live in the top project disclosure.

The shared Project query observes volume total/free/available space with `fs4` at
the canonical project path. It does not scan files, enumerate other disks or start
R. CPU/memory retain their actual Ark/R-process scope. Files and Session retain
observation/error/freshness independently; missing or stale values stay unknown.
Preferences merge against current shared settings. Draft sync now also checks the
ApplicationBridge document acknowledgements, independently of disk-file saving.

Validation passed: 327 frontend tests; all 15 Host project tests; 18 tests across
Contract, Project and Git; generated client/asset consistency, typecheck, Rust
formatting, architecture/frontend boundaries and fixtures, and documentation checks.
All 40 existing Chrome scenarios passed in the full run; both new shell scenarios
passed in a separate final run after correcting their temporary project's canonical
path. These 42 cases cover keyboard controls, retained preferences/drafts, native
input, disconnected metrics and 1920/1440/1024/800/600 px screenshots. Real-R HTTP
and MCP checks passed. The broad Rust workspace suite was not rerun.

A viewport test now awaits ResizeObserver geometry without weakening its bounds.
The new shell cases use a separate temporary Host instead of exceeding the main
suite's 32-window project budget. Native Host rejections that omit `result` retain
their actual error message rather than being obscured as an invalid reply. The
native disk test finishes in 0.10s after replacing slow whole-machine sampling
with the direct filesystem call. Evidence: `target/shell-{frontend-final,rust-domain,
project-tests,browser-verified,browser-isolated-final,workbench-real-r,mcp-real-r}.log`
and `target/studio-browser/shell-*.png`.

A separate preview at `target/experience/shell-review-5dR1zl/study` contains the
synthetic `workspace-demo.R`, its live objects and plot. It uses refreshable assets;
its browser is retained for user review with all three metrics pinned. Existing
Hosts and R sessions were preserved. Inspect current processes before launching
another Host. Native launch credentials remain in ignored local material.
Further first-version visual/usability feedback remains open.

## Object priority and whole-vector viewing

The user approved [Paper boards O07–O10](https://app.paper.design/file/01M1XBMB0B5QB82XMDV0Z6VHET/7-0)
on 2026-09-09 and authorized further refinements from real scenarios. The directory
now defaults to Name, Content and Type. Content shows values, dimensions, function
signatures, levels or colors. Fields controls and header dragging reorder, hide
and resize Content/Size/Type; Name stays first. Widths and visibility persist with
the view. Narrow panels retain compact semantic summaries and return to the saved
columns when widened.

Complete small palettes open as one strip or tile set in inline and dedicated
viewers. Selecting a color shows its original value, rendered hex and opacity.
Ordinary string vectors do not automatically open one string's detail. Long vectors
use ranges, explicit item inspection and a scrolling body with visible navigation.
Copy vector preserves original strings, names, NA, supported classes and complete
factor levels; explicit formats offer hex or selected/shown ranges. The shared
Objects owner gathers every requested page and text continuation on one native
observation before writing to the clipboard. Expiry, cancellation, missing pages,
unsupported exact representations and the 1 MiB / 100,000-value limits fail without
publishing a partial copy. A view opened during transient R activity resumes the
same observation when idle; it does not start or re-run R work.

Validation passed: 320 frontend tests, all 40 isolated Chrome scenarios, plus a
final two-scenario Chrome run after narrow-view refinements. Tests cover mouse/keyboard
field controls, saved order/width, approximately 320 px docked views with measured
visible color height, whole palettes,
Unicode continuations, duplicate names, factor levels, missing values and rejected
partial copies. A 252-value copied expression passes `identical()` in real R. Hex
conversion fails on a non-color value beyond the first page without changing the
clipboard. Table ordering/filtering, arrays and SCE browsing still pass. Real-R MCP
and Workbench checks, typecheck, generated-client consistency, architecture/frontend
boundaries and documentation checks also passed. The broad Rust workspace suite
was not rerun for this frontend change. Evidence is in `target/object-refinement-*.log`
and `target/studio-browser/object-{fields,palette}-*.png`.

The existing demo Host has been refreshed with new development assets; its live
objects, plots and unsaved script are preserved. No R Host was restarted to deliver
this refinement. Both inline and independent vector views use the same owner.
Further user feedback on information priority and real vector workflows remains open.

## Object viewers and directional collapse

The user authorized implementation of the six [Objects Paper boards](https://app.paper.design/file/01M1XBMB0B5QB82XMDV0Z6VHET/7-0)
on 2026-09-09, plus correction of full-column minimize behavior.
[Design section 14](RHO-DESIGN.md#14-objects--approved-viewing-experience) records the
approved interaction and named storage readers. Object lists now display bounded
native samples, values, dimensions, string lengths and canonical R colors.
Inline inspection and main-area viewers share the Objects owner, including
retained view preferences, nested containers, factor labels/codes, source text,
array slices and SCE/sparse storage. React Data Grid supplies the actual table
surface. Whole-table order/filter reads retain original row indices; oversized
copies, unsupported calendar filters and the one-million-row processing ceiling
are explicit limits. Current Host metadata controls extended table features.

Groups collapse along their parent split: full columns release width into a
38 px side rail; stacked panels release height. Original limits/weights restore,
and startup view reconciliation preserves collapsed state. Explicit activation
still restores the group. The user's existing development Host and R memory are
preserved; a frontend refresh cannot install the new native reader capabilities.
A reproducible synthetic review script is in
`target/experience/object-viewers-ready/study/objects-demo.R`.

Validation passed: 309 frontend tests, all 39 isolated Chrome scenarios, four
contract tests, all five real-R integration cases and the real CLI/session runner.
The native object script verifies full-table ordering/filtering, Unicode/special
values, array slices, non-executed source, R color interpretation and real SCE
counts/colData/PCA storage. Real-R MCP and Workbench checks passed, as did generated
bindings/client consistency, typecheck, architecture/frontend boundaries, Rust
formatting and governance checks. A broad Rust workspace run was interrupted;
it is not recorded as a complete pass. Current evidence logs are
`target/object-viewer-{browser-verified,frontend-final,contract-tests,real-r-suite,mcp-tests,workbench-tests}.log`.

The review Host is running for
`target/experience/object-viewers-ready/study`, using refreshable development
assets. Its retained browser has executed `objects-demo.R`; the 2,700-row table,
canonical colors, SCE and plot objects are real synthetic R fixtures. Inspect this
Host before starting another instance for that project. Its private launch URL
remains in ignored local material. Existing user Hosts were not restarted.
Screenshots are under `target/studio-browser/`; successful inspection does not
replace further user feedback on interaction quality.

## Agent Chinese input composition

The reported Pinyin-to-literal-text bug was reproduced through Chrome's native
composition protocol: `ni → nihao` produced `ninihao`, with JavaScript value writes
back to the previous text between input events. This occurs before draft autosave;
the controlled textarea was backed directly by asynchronously notified task state.
The message input now leaves native preedit in the DOM, reconciles external text
only outside composition, and sends confirmed text to the draft owner. Resizing
and @ completion also wait for committed input. IME confirmation/229/post-end keys
cannot submit, and an ownership change retains a local conflict copy.

Focused tests passed: native Chrome composition across autosave/poll intervals,
delayed draft ACK during composition, committed-only saving and explicit subsequent
Enter. These are browser-native CDP tests. The user separately tested the corrected
ime-test page with their actual input method and confirmed it works on 2026-09-09.
This confirms that configuration, not every possible OS/IME combination. Validation
passed: 300 frontend tests, all 36 isolated Chrome scenarios, frontend boundary
checks/fixtures, typecheck, client build/generated-asset consistency, current binary
build and governance checks. The regression also preserves the original attachments
when composition finishes after another window takes control. The task selector
now has a distinct accessible label from the New task action. Evidence is in
`target/agent-task-development/ime-{unit,chrome-final}.log`. The user's existing
trial Host/page is preserved. A separate `target/experience/agent-ime-review/ime-test`
workspace uses refreshable development assets for testing the corrected client.

## Agent activity and real-analysis integration

The user's ggtree trial exposed failures beyond panel presentation. The recorded
connection took about two seconds; native thinking then continued without a visible
phase. Rho's fixed 600-second ACP prompt deadline stopped observing a native turn
that completed after about 729 seconds. The final response was lost. An invalid
`output_mode: all` was obscured by an incompatible MCP structured-error envelope.
A subsequent corrected R submission waited behind a failed-run pause and hit the
native MCP request timeout. The original successful R operation saved a PNG but
did not emit a Plots artifact; the native final message incorrectly claimed it did.

Implemented: bounded native phase observations and an animated conversation status,
including quiet time, driven by existing Coordinator observations; ACP prompt
correlation until native completion/transport closure; readable MCP rejections;
typed R output modes; default R acceptance receipts with queue-state read links;
live Studio context and document/media guidance in native input. Structured
window/document/action/media identities are expanded in the tool schema after a
real GLM run repeatedly encoded reference-only parameters as strings. Native
permission callback content/diffs are retained, not just the tool title.

Real Kimi/GLM analysis also reproduced a captured-save bug: a partial Rust-generated
patch encoded unchanged context as removed/added lines and Git rejected it despite
the correct file digest. Captured saves now emit real unified-diff context. The
regression applies start/interior/deletion/unchanged/Unicode/CRLF/no-final-newline
edits through Git and checks exact bytes. The external Agent remains responsible
for its R code; failed scientific operations retain their actual outcomes.

Verified with Kimi Code 0.41.0 and `b-ai/glm-5.3-flash`: the same native session
resumed after upgrading the disposable Host, retained the corrected Editor draft,
saved and ran it successfully, read the real image through MCP, explicitly selected
it in Plots and returned a final response with a succeeded submission receipt.
The 800×600 PNG is retained by its producing R operation; the original failed runs
and intentionally interrupted turn retain their actual statuses. Refresh preserved
the saved script, selected image and conversation. Native image inspection rejected
an incomplete reference; the Agent corrected it using the full owner reference.
This validates recovery and completion, not error-free model-generated R code.

Checks passed: 250 Rust workspace tests (seven opt-in cases skipped), all five
real-R cases plus the real CLI/session runner, 303 frontend tests, 37 isolated Chrome
scenarios, real-R MCP acceptance/paused-queue recovery, native task crash/resume
fixtures, generated bindings/client checks, architecture/frontend boundaries,
governance and vendor integrity. All nine focused Chrome cases passed after the
permission-detail disclosure and selected-plot unread-count fixes; 29 native-client
tests passed after the final permission-excerpt redaction review. Evidence logs
and the verified preview `ggtree-final.png` are in `target/agent-task-development/`.
The configured Kimi global Rho MCP entry remains disabled; existing user Hosts were
preserved. Only owned disposable Hosts were restarted. Actual provider thinking
latency remains variable; it is now visible rather than converted into a false
terminal timeout.

## Parent-region docking refinement

The 2026-09-09 follow-up identified an unreachable/unclear parent docking path:
Agent could land beside Plots, while the requested destination was the common
right of Objects and Plots. The floating parent matrix was below the native
transparent drag overlay and included the source in region names. The new client
places reachable arrow targets at shared panel boundaries, highlights the whole
destination and previews the final occupied area. Native single-panel and workspace
edge drops remain available, with Move To for explicit placement. Target names omit
the dragged source; the engine can redistribute space released by that source.

The user's live trial window was moved through the existing placement command to
Agent beside the complete Objects/Plots column. No Host, Agent task or R session was
restarted. The running Host retains its embedded client; the improved drag targets
are in the rebuilt client for subsequent launches. Validation passed: 296 frontend
tests (including the parent/source-extraction regression), all 34 isolated Chrome
scenarios, frontend boundary checks/fixtures, typecheck, generated client consistency,
current binary build and governance checks. The real mouse-drag case verifies exact
preview/drop geometry, draft preservation, no Agent commands, undo and Escape.
Screenshots are `target/studio-browser/agent-parent-drag-{preview,result}.png`; the
full Chrome log is `target/agent-task-development/parent-docking-chrome.log`.

## Workspace Agent tasks

The user approved the fourteen [Paper Agent boards](https://app.paper.design/file/01M1XBMB0B5QB82XMDV0Z6VHET/6-2)
and authorized the complete first-version implementation, using Kimi Code with
`b-ai/glm-5.3-flash` (GLM 5.3 Flash, B.AI) for real development tests.
The independent Agent page retains those boards; the general workspace page was
not repurposed. [Design section 13](RHO-DESIGN.md#13-workspace-agent-tasks--approved-interaction)
records the approved interaction and native-capability distinctions.

The singleton dockable Agent panel now owns daily task chat, a wide task rail or
narrow selector, per-task saved drafts/conflict copies, rename/archive, native
permissions beside the composer, attachments and @ context previews. Settings
retains discovery, explicit installation, models, manual MCP and independent Test.
No CLI is scanned or model request sent merely by opening the panel. Window-local
selection/reading state stays in ApplicationPersistence; R-session changes do not
remove Agent tasks. Files/editor/R tables/plots use their existing read owners;
plugins have a read-only information-source registration seam, not an installed
illustrative analysis plugin.

ApplicationStore has additive typed task/attachment/draft/receipt/event/asset tables.
The Host task service owns admission and native lifetime, request deduplication,
draft CAS, controller/generation fencing, eight-connection budgets and bounded
observations. Receipts and terminal states persist immediately; durable cursors
are distinct from in-flight native observations. A stopped/uncertain connection
cannot bypass old-process proof through Disconnect or Resume. Native CLI history
is never reconstructed from Rho's display cache or used to replay scientific work.
Codex uses exact thread resume and native pages; Kimi uses verified exact-ID load
and context replay; DeepSeek uses resume/close/resume after interruption to clear
its native Inbox. User configuration and the disabled global Kimi rho MCP entry
remain unchanged; each task receives a fresh explicit MCP connection.

Executed evidence in `target/agent-task-development/`:

- `kimi-task-acceptance.log`: real Kimi 0.41.0 / B.AI GLM 5.3 Flash; two same-model
  tasks return separate alpha/beta responses, duplicate request IDs do not replay,
  both resume the same native ID, and the resumed Agent performs a new MCP overview
  read of the correct disposable project. Original configuration hashes unchanged.
- `kimi-recovery.log`, `codex-recovery.log`, `deepseek-recovery.log`: each real
  runtime survives a forced, independent Host crash through explicit same-ID Resume.
  The saved next draft and old uncertain receipt remain. Kimi/Codex identify a new
  red-square image; DeepSeek accepts only the new instruction. All three actually
  perform an MCP overview read through the new Host endpoint/credentials afterward.
- `codex-task-acceptance.log`: real Codex / gpt-6-astra; two concurrent tasks,
  exact separate responses, request deduplication and same-ID resume passed.
- `deepseek-task-acceptance.log`: real DeepSeek / 115-newapi deepseek-v4-flash;
  two same-model tasks, duplicate-request protection, same-ID resume and resumed
  native MCP overview passed. Native configuration hashes remained unchanged.
- `deepseek-native-inbox.log`: the installed lock-matched native Inbox implementation
  restores input queued before a crash, persists its removal on clear, and claims
  only a fresh instruction after another reconstruction. No model or user session
  is used by this deterministic native-code test.
- `fixture-recovery.log`: deterministic ACP crash/restart verifies no prompt during
  resume, changed Host MCP address/credential fingerprint, original uncertainty and
  image delivery. Native protocol tests cover Codex quiet/history/cursor rules,
  Kimi replay/session fencing and DeepSeek queued-Inbox cleanup/failed-close refusal.
- `chrome-final.log`: the full isolated Chrome suite passed **33/33**, including
  normal/narrow/wide Agent layouts, native permission modes/options, archived-task
  reminders while closed, two-window takeover, attachments, real R tables/plots,
  independent diagnostics and existing editor/layout/scroll/execution regressions.
- `frontend-tests.log`: **295 frontend tests** passed. Source ownership boundaries,
  generated bindings/embedded assets, typecheck and strict workspace Clippy passed.
- `task-service-final.log`: **10 focused Host task tests** passed, including plugin
  source containment, stale ownership, stop/closing races and uncertain resume.
- `workspace-tests.log`: **244 full-workspace Rust tests** passed; **7 conditional
  external tests** were ignored, not counted as passes. The final native-client
  run passed **25 tests**, including unconfirmed native submission errors.
- Real R, MCP and Workbench checks passed, including MCP/Workbench with real R.
  Environment, native-process recovery, local SSH/Slurm protocol, output-media,
  vendor integrity, governance and Agent-harness self-tests passed. These local
  protocol/self-tests do not claim remote-cluster or new scientific acceptance.

Live integration caught DeepSeek's lack of embedded-resource capability; text
context now uses native text input with its source retained. Chrome review corrected
file-kind filtering, the plot query name, constrained-picker clipping and a test's
window-list pagination. Native progress commentary remains separate from the final
answer; acceptance assertions now inspect the final native message.

Existing user Hosts and their R memory were not restarted. All new test Hosts use
disposable projects. The older native integration remains the basis for explicit
DeepSeek component setup (official 0.1.2-alpha.2) and manual MCP settings. Kimi's
global rho MCP entry stays disabled; task-specific injection has independently
passed real MCP reads. Build/runtime installation/publication remain separate;
this work does not install or replace a user Host automatically. An independent
trial project is available at `target/experience/agent-tasks-ready/study`, with a
blank Kimi task set to GLM 5.3 Flash (B.AI). It was opened in the app browser without
sending a model prompt. Its launch material stays in ignored local files; inspect
that project's live Host before starting another instance.

## Agent interface acceptance baseline

The Agent interface and standard Skills delivery is implemented and verified.
The frozen runtime/harness acceptance version is
`4bcd30903b55568844b20fb93589294b1a8c5f9d`. Evidence-packaging changes through
`a3f08a6` did not change that verified scientific runtime, client assets or
acceptance harness. The connection work above extends the current transport;
the frozen acceptance remains evidence for its recorded baseline only.

Shared Host discovery, concrete capability/result/recovery contracts, diagnostics
and read navigation cover the existing scientific owners. Objects and text use
bounded version-bound reads; package indexes bind exact installed copies; help
renders once from the selected database into retained text. Output reads share
verified originals, bounded native image previews, crops and resource chunks.

Application owns window identities, synchronized drafts/context, CAS receipts and
immutable scientific captures. The resident Studio bridge preserves concurrent
input and startup view choices. Saving/running retains the original caller through
the existing OperationGateway. Standalone CLI queries do not start R, acquire a
writer lease or recover operations; connected CLI requests use the existing Host.

Standard `.agents/skills` and launcher-attested native sources retain their original
resource bytes, enablement and source identities. Read receipts and explicit method
bindings are application metadata. Skills do not grant authority or run an Agent
loop. Native queries do not reload deliberately unloaded inspection/JSON providers.

## Verified evidence

- Rust workspace: 199 default tests passed. All seven separately enabled real-R
  and Environment tests passed through the native verification scripts; none was
  counted as passed while ignored. Strict whole-workspace Clippy passed.
- Frontend: 270 tests and 24 ownership/boundary fixtures passed. Generated DTOs,
  embedded assets and the current binary were checked together.
- Chrome: all 26 cases passed. Normal, wide and constrained screenshots were
  inspected. The fixed Gapminder load case measured typing p95 34.4 ms and frame
  p95 16.8 ms; additional views did not duplicate shared reads.
- Real Workbench/MCP, exact help, native image/resources, pak/renv realization,
  installer cancellation, retention/quarantine/restore/purge, lost-commit recovery,
  restart binding, CLI connection/query purity, process recovery, local SSH/Slurm
  protocol fixtures, architecture/governance and Jet checks passed. The original
  user R library was unchanged. No live remote-cluster acceptance is claimed.
- Independent Codex: **30/30 core runs and 4/4 Skills/adaptation runs passed**, with
  zero violations/failures, exact native/Rho method equivalence, and unchanged
  source/binary hashes. Model `gpt-6-astra`, reasoning `high`, Codex 0.153.4.
  Each run stayed within 80 calls, 1 MiB text and ten minutes. Maximum observed:
  30 calls, 524,698 text bytes and 197,407 ms. Images were metered separately.

The formal run retained 614 hashed artifacts (58,627,766 bytes) and took 16m55s
with three independent workers. Totals: 382 model tool attempts, 380 matched MCP
deliveries, 4,060,795 text bytes and 136,584 image bytes. Actual usage fields:
10,820,205 input tokens; 9,443,328 cached input; 46,945 output; 1,822 reasoning output.

The authoritative formal result is
`target/agent-interface/acceptance/4bcd30903b55-1788916155502-8ec26ea9/manifest.json`.
It records `acceptance=true`, `passed=true`, `fixed_tree=true`, all 34 results,
resource equivalence, original operation identities and the artifact inventory.
All earlier failed attempts remain under `target/agent-interface/acceptance`.
Command logs are under `target/agent-interface`; visual reviews are under
`target/studio-browser`. The evidence packer preserves originals, includes failed
attempts, sanitizes credentials in text/nested traces and records source/archive
hashes. Its tests and CI mapping are separate from scientific acceptance.

Frozen acceptance binary SHA256:
`c1b0157931004efa6af2fd76f8b9c6eab2f58bb08211877d8ce67a074f2dad91`.

## Operational boundaries

Existing user Hosts, R memory and configuration were preserved. All acceptance
instances were disposable. No product installation, signing or publication was
performed. Read [Operations](OPERATIONS.md) before starting another Host; inspect
current ownership and processes rather than reusing old PIDs, ports or tokens.
All Cargo invocations remain serial; build and verify from the integration checkout.

Native session evidence covers the managed fork/exec helper family. Unobservable
same-family processes and missing original evidence stay protected; independent
service-manager jobs and rollback of arbitrary external effects are not implied.

The approved Packages interaction remains in
[Paper](https://app.paper.design/file/01M1XBMB0B5QB82XMDV0Z6VHET/3-0).
Multiple runtimes/R-version switching, plugin execution, package-management UI,
abandoned-data migration, product installation and publication remain deferred.
The external acceptance runner is test tooling, not a product Agent behavior loop.
